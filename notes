things that i neeed to do:
probably add a streamlit to this interface - done
make it go through python codes and cpp codes alike (something about switchbox)
if sufficient time is present try using a gnn (not sure on this though) (implementation will be a hassle + need to learn)
improve confidence in certain semantic errors (get it above 80%)
